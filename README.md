# Spotify_data_analysis

In this project I am looking to analyse some data gained for the Spotify API.
I have slightly re-written the API class I wrote previously to allow me to parse in the year.
This means I have data by year for analysis.
I then exported the pandas data frame into a csv file so I can being my analysis.

# Setup
pip install requests
pip install pandas
